## 👨‍🎓 About Me

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the **The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)**. My research focuses on **Medical/Surgical Robotics**, **Surgical Navigation**, and **Human-Robot Interaction**, with a particular interest in force sensing technologies for precise and autonomous surgical systems.
I received my Ph.D. degree from the **University of New South Wales (UNSW)** in 2025, supervised by Prof. Liao Wu. Prior to that, I obtained my M.E. degree from the **Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITsz)** in 2021, supervised by Prof. Max Q.-H. Meng.
My current work aims to enhance the safety and autonomy of robotic surgery through multimodal perception and artificial intelligence.
